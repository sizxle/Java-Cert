- also know as intern pool
- it is a location on the `JVM` that collects all common strings in a programme
- String pool contains all `literal values` and `constants` that appear on your program.
	- e.g.
		- "name" - goes to the string pool
		- myObject.toString()-> does not go to the string poo;

###### Note
	-Strings are immutable and literals are pooled
